This is a (slow) AWK implementation of the basE91 decoder. It decodes from
standard input to standard output.

Example usage:

	awk -f b91dec.awk < file.b91 > file.bin
  or
	./b91dec.awk < file.b91 > file.bin


Be careful on non-Unix systems! - During output, some ported versions of awk
automatically convert byte values of 0x0A to the native line break sequence of
the host system (e.g. 0x0D 0x0A under DOS/Windows). This can result in corrupt
binary files.
You should test on some examples and compare the output of b91dec.awk with the
original data before relying on it.
