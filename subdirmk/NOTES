&CAPS		=>	subdir_CAPS  			or TOP_CAPS
&lc		=>	subdir/lc    			or lc

&_		=>	subdir_				or TOP_
&/		=>	subdir/				or nothing
&=_		=>	subdir				or TOP
&=/		=>	subdir				or .
&^		=>	$(top_srcdir)/subdir		or $(top_srcdir)
&~		=>	$(abs_top_srcdir)/subdir	or $(abs_top_srcdir)

&&		=>	&&
\&		=>	&

& thing thing... &	=>	each thing prefixed by &/ &^ &~ resp
& ^ thing thing... &		each thing is any non-ws
& ~ thing thing... &		& may be omitted before EOL or before \EOL
				other &'s not recognised

CAPS is [A-Z][0-9_A-Z]*(?!\w)
lc is [a-z][-+,0-9_a-z]*(?!\w)

&!<spaces or tabs>	disables & *until* EOL (and disappears)

&!STUFF		STUFF is recognised instead of & (beyond EOL)
		STUFF is either all ASCII punct or all ASCII alphanum (incl _)
		any lwsp after STUFF is discarded too

eg notably
 STUFF!&		now & is recognised instead (ie back to normal)
 STUFFSTUFF	STUFF

eg
 &!@@@		@@@ is recognised instead of &
 @@@!&		go back to &

&TARGETS[_things]		is handled specially
				must be spelled precisely this way
				if no _things, means _all

Also, `all' is weird in that it is present even if not specified
