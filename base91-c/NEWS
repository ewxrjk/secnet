[0.6.0] 2006-11-01
* basE91 encoding/decoding routines restructured to be thread-safe
* lots of type fixes
* new core utility is `base91', with a behaviour similar to GNU base64
* introduce `-w' switch for wrapping encoded output lines after given length
* long option handling
* use standard I/O functions for better portability
* MinGW compatibility code added
* minor extensions to `make check'
* Java-tool wraps output lines by default; can be avoided with the `-u' switch
* license changed to BSD

[0.5.2] 2006-08-25
* code cleanup
* encoder for DOS rewritten to be faster and compatible down to Intel 8086

[0.5.1] 2005-10-05
* Java-b91enc now handles file extensions case insensitively
* native DOS version of basE91 encoder added

[0.5.0] 2005-06-24
* ATTENTION: this version breaks backward compatibility because the basE91
  alphabet was changed to reduce the occurrence of double quotes - sorry, I
  should have done this long before
* b91dec is installed as a link to b91enc
* `-e' option added (complement to `-d')
* build system should be more portable now

[0.4.2] 2005-05-16
* AWK basE91 decoder no longer depends on GNU extensions
* Java byte code removed (distributed separately in a jar file)

[0.4.1] 2005-05-07
* some code cleanup
* Java-b91enc can break encoded output to lines of 76 characters (`-b' switch)

[0.4.0] 2005-04-26
* improved encoder behaviour on stream ends (can save one byte sometimes)
* allocate buffer memory dynamically; use overlapping buffers
* new `-m' switch can be used for testing
* verbose mode extended: `-vv' shows memory statistics
* `make check' implemented - runs some basic tests

[0.3.1] 2005-04-19
* b91enc has a verbose mode now (`-v' switch)
* Java-b91enc accepts command line syntax with only one FILE argument again

[0.3.0] 2005-04-17
* the code was restructured to allow a more universal use of the basE91 backend
* version switch changed to `-V' which is more common - sorry for that
* `make install' is possible now
* changed Java-b91enc to be a bit more similar to the C version
* implementation in PHP added

[0.2.3] 2005-04-11
* man page included (thanks to Kei!)
* version (-v) switch added

[0.2.2] 2005-04-10
* fixed a bug in decoder that could result in corrupt output on 64-bit systems
* Java class files included

[0.2.1] 2005-04-09
* first public release
