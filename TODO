dh.c: change format to binary from decimal string (without introducing
endianness problems)

netlink.c: test the 'allow_route' option properly.
Add fragmentation code.  Check that we comply with RFC1812.

random.c: test properly

resolver.c: ought to return a list of addresses for each address; the
site code ought to remember them and try contacting them in turn.

rsa.c: check padding type, change format to binary from decimal string
(without introducing endianness problems)

site.c: Abandon key exchanges when a bad packet is received. Modify
protocol to include version fields, as described in the NOTES
file. Implement keepalive mode. Make policy about when to initiate key
exchanges more configurable (how many NAKs / bad reverse-transforms
does it take to prompt a key exchange?)

slip.c: restart userv-ipif to cope with soft routes? Restart it if it
fails in use?

transform.c: separate the transforms into multiple parts, which can
then be combined in the configuration file.  Will allow the user to
plug in different block ciphers, invent an authenticity-only mode,
etc. (similar to udptunnel)

udp.c: option for path-MTU discovery (once fragmentation support is
implemented in netlink)


global:
consider using liboop for the event loop
