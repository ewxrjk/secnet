configure.in: done

Makefile.in: autodep stuff

conffile.c: done

dh.c: change format to binary from decimal string (without introducing
endianness problems)

netlink.c: done. jdamery reports tun-old code works on Linux-2.2

random.c: test

resolver.c: done

rsa.c: check padding type, change format to binary from decimal string
(without introducing endianness problems)

secnet.c: done

site.c: the site_incoming() routing could be implemented much more
cleanly using a table. There's still quite a lot of redundancy in this
file. Abandon key exchanges when a bad packet is received. Tell
netlink link is down if it's down and we don't have address for other
end.

transform.c: done. Needs checking for endianness problems.

udp.c: done

util.c: sort out logging

General: check over MBM's patches for BSD.
