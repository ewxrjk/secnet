secnet (0.3.3~beta1) unstable; urgency=low

  Installation compatibility fix:
  * In make-secnet-sites, always use our own ipaddr.py even if the
    incompatible modern ipaddr.py is installed (eg via python-ipaddr.deb).
    (Future versions of secnet are going to need that Python module to be
    installed.)

  For links involving mobile sites:
  * Use source of NAK packets as hint for peer transport address.
  * When initiating rekey, make use of data transport peer addresses.

  Build fix:
  * Provide clean target in test-example/Makefile.

secnet (0.3.2~beta1) unstable; urgency=low

  For links involving mobile sites:
  * SECURITY: Properly update peer address array when it is full.
  * Do name-resolution on peer-initiated key setup too, when we are mobile
    (and other name-resolution improvements).

  Other minor improvements:
  * Log peer addresses on key exchange timeout.
  * When printing version (eg during startup), use value from git-describe
    and thus include git commit id where applicable.
  * Updates to release checklist in Makefile.in.
  * Use C99 _Bool for bool_t.
