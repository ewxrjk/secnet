This directory contains some files useful for ad-hoc tests.
With these it is possible to run a test of secnet on a Linux host
even if that Linux host does not have another working network connection.

The keys here are (obviously) public.  They were generated like this:
 ssh-keygen -C inside@example.com -f test-example/inside.key -t rsa1 -b 1024
 ssh-keygen -C outside@example.com -f test-example/outside.key -t rsa1 -b 1024
 # edit sites to paste {inside,outside}.key.pub into pubkey lines
 base64 <inside.key >inside.key.b64
 base64 <outside.key >outside.key.b64

To run the test:
 Run the makefile:
  make -C test-example/
 In one window, as root
  ./secnet -dvnc test-example/inside.conf
 And in another
  ./secnet -dvnc test-example/outside.conf
 Then in a third
  ping -I secnet-test-i 172.18.232.2
