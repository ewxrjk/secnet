Known bugs in secnet

(Complaints from Ian:)
Your init.d script makes it hard to start secnet as non-root, too.

secnet -jv has printed a large routing table full of stuff I wasn't
interested in.

Make explicit in the documentation that -n causes all log output to go
to stderr.  Provide an option that is _really_ just "don't fork()" for
people who want to run secnet from init.
